            <h4 class="committee_number">Ph:&nbsp;&nbsp;087&nbsp;243&nbsp;4453</h4>
            <p>Hide your paddles around this one, he may be captain and a level 4 kayaker but that won't stop him
                leaving paddles under a rock somewhere in the hills of Kerry. If you are a fan of wearing a seat belt
                and knowing how fast you are driving I would politely decline any offers of a lift in our captain's car.
                John is more than capable of keeping the club afloat for another year and ready to bring us to Varsities
                again for a hoped second victory. *Side note* don't worry about the noises that him and our spicy
                secretary seem incapable of making, when together, and feel free to tell them to stop (not necessarily
                that politely). If you are having trouble spotting John he is the one with the brown shoes... which he
                never takes off.</p>

            <h4 class="committee_number">Ph:&nbsp;&nbsp;086&nbsp;321&nbsp;2333</h4>
            <p>Our secretary for this year is the very spicy Jack Van Lang. This spicy Wicklow born and bread boy is
                best know for his name not actually being VAN Lang. Guaranteed to spice up your night by needing you to
                call an ambulance for him, or to bring him home after he breaks his fresher of the year trophy. While
                studying politics and social computing (all of about 3 hours a week) he was our most dedicated fresher
                last year travelling up and down from Wicklow for pool sessions, he now lives in Dublin (with the
                elusive Ailbhe 5) to keep up his dedication to the club. If you are a fan of memes this is the guy you
                want to be friends with. </p>

            <h4 class="committee_number">Ph:&nbsp;&nbsp;085&nbsp;771&nbsp;0407</h4>
            <p>You will definitely hear this one coming. Emma is our treasure for the year and probably the loudest
                member in the club. From Blackrock this nursing student will have no problem chasing people for money
                and keeping the finances in check. If anyone ever has any questions about scouts this is your go to gal,
                she knows it all. Due to her fab photography skills she will be supplying Becca our PRO with all her
                photos for the club accounts. Just incase you do happen to not hear her coming make sure to watch out
                for her swag-o-lishous walk.
                Fun Fact: Emma physically cannot whisper</p>

            <p>Safety officer for this year is our very own Shanley. In his third year of computer science, this
                skateboarding, black belt in karate dude with his luscious locks is bound to keep us all safe on the
                water. At 6'5" he is definitely the longest member of the club. From over in the west county of Sligo
                it's hard to stop this gentle giant running home to visit his Mammy every chance he gets. Known to party
                hard he will somehow squish himself into a play boat the next day to show off some of his gnar freestyle
                skills.</p>

            <p>Get ready to be put to the test this year with Cian as training officer. This second year business and
                law student will put you through your paces keeping everyone up to date with assessments and safety
                courses, along with keeping (those willing) fit as a fiddle with paddle fit. Although it may only be his
                second year in the club there is no question that he is up to the task of keeping us in shape to get us
                ready for varsities victory X2.</p>

            <p>Jonathan is our equipment officer for this year. This 3rd year med student, from the hills of Donegal
                will help you get kitted out in some of the sexiest, old, damp wetsuits you have ever seen, all while
                protecting the new gear like the were his own. If you are lucky you might just get to hear a jig from
                his not often seen fiddle, but you are far more likely to experience Jonathans dance moves after a few
                too many in Doyles.</p>

            <p>This years current Public Relations Officer is Rebecca. Hailing from the wonderful county of fake Meath,
                this 21 year old nursing student sure knows her way around a farm. Watch out country boys! Or if you're
                tall, she'll spot you a mile away. The club has found that she is very handy with a needle and thread
                (steri strips too) during trips away. Note: Simonâ€™s chin. She always has a smile on her face. She is
                always up for a good dress up from spiders to strawberries, she'll definitely organise some great
                activities for us this year.</p>

            <h4 class="committee_number">Ph:&nbsp;&nbsp;087&nbsp;237&nbsp;6242</h4>
            <p>Genesis 1:27 Then God said, "Let us make man in my image, after my likeness to rule". Conor was
                handcrafted by the Gods themselves to watch over the club, a man of divine knowledge. His jawline could
                cut through steel, and not to mention that smile, that damn smile. Don't let his quiet and reserved
                nature fool you, he is a man of passion with an insatiable appetite. "Flexible", "succubus", "the king"
                all have been used to describe this celestial being. As a 4th year student nurse (promise he is the last
                one) he is well used to chatting shit to strangers and will no doubt make you feel welcome to the club
                with his damn contagious smile. After a rough start to the club of taking 5 weeks to learn how to
                T-rescue, his biggest accomplishment is learning to roll in under 10 minutes. Make sure you take the
                time to have a chat with him. He'll definitely have something interesting to tell you.</p>

            <p>Our Senior treasurer for the year is Ross another engineer on the committee. Ross has paddled across the
                world in the Alps and in Uganda. Definitely check out his world famous calves! (Thatâ€™s what paddle fit
                could do for you) Itâ€™s a pity he still doesn't really know how to cook. But if you want an unhealthy
                snack of chocolate milk you've got the right person. If you want to get to know this guy ask him about
                his interesting taste in music or about his absolute love of trains (not actually joking). Most
                importantly for getting advice on some gear for yourself this is the man to ask.</p>
