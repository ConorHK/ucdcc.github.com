		<h3 class="committee_title">Ross Kerrigan - Captain</h3>
		
		<p>It&#39;s a long way to Tipperary, but for our Captain Kerrigan, no journey is too long when a chocolate cupcake is in hand! With a punny sense of humour (pun intended), Ross has kayaked since his secondary school days and after a venture in the Alps this summer, has certainly proved that he&#39;s up for the job! Just make sure to keep an eye on your biscuits at Club lunches at the Board as our Captain has a sweet tooth that matches how sweet he is on Kayaking (ok, I&#39;ll stop now). Ross is starting his Masters in Mechanical Engineering; one of few UCDCC members who did not go to the Dark side and move to Computer Science.

		<h3 class="committee_title">Aoife Sheridan - Secretary</h3>
		
		<p>Dublin born and bred, our Secretary Aoife is a third year nursing student, whose love of Kayaking stems from many an excursion as a youngster, including a Junior Liffey Descent. This obsession has certainly flourished, along with her unique sense of humour that fits right in with UCDCC. With a summer filled with polo competitions and purchasing her own boat, Carl, Aoife will be handling the more serious administrative side of the club. Fortunately, she will also bring some excitement to the Disco Paddlers by organising weekends away, to let all the new members get to know one another.

		  <h3 class="committee_title">Ailbhe Tuohy - Treasurer</h3>
		  
		  <p>Hailing from the Banner County, Ailbhe is entering her second year of Biomedical Engineering and our resident Ms. Moneybags. Kayaking for only a year, she has been infected with a love of water, matching her deep blue eyes. Due to her history and experience of playing tag rugby, Ailbhe&#39;s become a keen polo player and has adapted to the Club&#39;s cheery and friendly banter. However, this has encouraged her feistiness, hence her bio picture. This is exactly why you don&#39;t want our Treasurer to pull this face when you owe her money!

		  <h3 class="committee_title">Steven Mulrooney - Safety Officer</h3>
		  
		  <p>The younger Mulrooney brother from Avoca in Co. Wicklow, Steven is our current Safety Officer also familiar with his brother&#39;s role as Training officer, when he was on last year&#39;s committee. This followed his achievement of winning Fresher of the Year 2013. As a Third year Food Scientist, will be able to warn you of the danger of your food as well as the dangers of the river. He will also keep your energy up on the water by bringing along delicious snacks and hot drinks. Our &#147;Floating Traffic Cone&#148; will most likely be seen capturing many kayaking-related moments with his beloved GoPro, so you&#39;ll never forget the priceless memories.

		  <h3 class="committee_title">David Mulrooney - Training Officer</h3>
		  
		  <p>Better known as Zog! The oldest of the Club&#39;s two Mulrooney Committee members, Zog is taking over his younger brother&#39;s position as training officer. He is ready to whip us all into shape for 2014/15. After a summer of lifeguarding in beautiful Brittas Bay, this final year mad scientist from Wicklow has the enthusiasm over the past year to both party hard and paddle hard. Favouring water sports of all kinds, we are in good hands this year with Zog as he&#39;ll prepare us for our various trips over Ireland; be they local or further afield.

		  <h3 class="committee_title">Andy Jeffers - Equipment Officer</h3>
		  
		  <p>Our Equipment officer (Quippy) Andy, originally from Athy, who made the move to Cork, has many skills including organising and keeping track of our gear&#133; moonlighting as our Club &#147;Canuggler&#148; (Canoe Juggler). After living on a barge as a Fresher &#45; Andy is definitely no stranger to the water! As a trainee instructor, this second year Electrics and Electronic Engineering student will be there to answer any question about what specific gear you need or which boat is the perfect fit. In no time he&#39;ll have you addicted to the game Cards Against Humanity, as much as you&#39;ll become addicted to the Club!

		  <h3 class="committee_title">Naddy Jones - Public Relations Officer</h3>
		  
		  <p>Another Dubliner amongst us, Naddy has a heart for adventure and fun, so naturally we made her this year&#39;s P.R.O. (note: the P doesn&#39;t actually stand for Pirate!) This final year Arts student, specialising in English Lit. and Art History, wasn&#39;t even kayaking a year before she had managed to claim her own island in scenic Kerry. For this coming year, it is her mission to steal every member of the Club away on entertaining nights out and all other Club events. She appreciates all disciplines of kayaking and will be seen going down rivers in her boat, Princess Bluebell. </p>

		  <h3 class="committee_title">Yvette Schutten - New Members Liason</h3>
		  
		  <p>Conveniently from Ireland&#39;s County of lakes, this bubbly Cavan Kayaker is our current NML; pictured here before winning Best Costume at Kayaking Varsities 2014. Yvette&#39;s job is to make sure all the fresh faces stay fresh by helping them out on the water, even when they end up in it! This eager second year Physiotherapist; will have you working up a sweat on the banks and making sure those muscles are warmed up for every kayak trip. Most importantly, she will try her best to have everyone smiling all the way through. Just don&#39;t rob her turnips!
