					<h4 class="committee_number">Ph:&nbsp;&nbsp;086&nbsp;235&nbsp;1552</h4>
		
		
					<p>Oh captain our captain! After previously holding the position of treasurer and being awarded the prestigious Dee cup last year, Ailbhe has proved she has what it takes to be the leader of our club. This third year engineer from Co. Clare may seem small in stature but if she decides to channel her inner rugby player on a night out stay clear, she&rsquo;s known to take down people twice her size! As Captain Ailbhe will ensure the club is running to its full potential and great craic is had throughout the year!</p>

					<h3 class="committee_title">Yvette Schutten - Secretary</h3>
		
					<h4 class="committee_number">Ph:&nbsp;&nbsp;089&nbsp;219&nbsp;8039</h4>
		
		
					<p>Yvette&rsquo;s second year on committee sees her move from NML to the more administrative post of secretary where she will take care of the day to day running of the club and also organising our many trips away. As a third year physio student Yvette has perfected her massage techniques and is more than happy to give shoulder rubs and ease sore muscles after a long day on the river. Being an avid polo player Yvette&rsquo;s loyalties are tested as she decides whether her heart lies with UCDCC or with her hometown club in Cavan.</p>

					<h3 class="committee_title">Jacqui Mernagh - Treasurer</h3>
		
					<h4 class="committee_number">Ph:&nbsp;&nbsp;087&nbsp;781&nbsp;5072</h4>
		  
		  
					<p>Introducing the &ldquo;new and improved&rdquo; Jacqui as she likes to describe herself. Changes are said to include less slut drop competitions (it&rsquo;s not like she won any of them), fewer nights in The Palace (we know what happened last time) and the ceasing of three hour lunches at the board. A love of accounting has been instilled in Jacqui since her secondary school days and as a second year commerce student the role of treasurer is a great fit. Don&rsquo;t miss club lunches as its highly likely Jacqui will have her baking done and treat as all to the best brownies and caramel squares that you have ever tasted!</p>

					<h4 class="committee_number">Ph:&nbsp;&nbsp;083&nbsp;107&nbsp;4285</h4>		  
		  
					<p>Who better to look after the safety of our members the a girl whose rarely seen without a sling or a pair of crutches (she&rsquo;s only a slight breeze away from a dislocated shoulder). With this injury record Aoife knows exactly what not to do on a river and will guide us all down without a scratch! Previously holding the positions of both NML and Secretary this local Dubliner knows all about Committee and being a 4th year nursing student will be well able to cope with first aid problems we encounter.</p>

					<h3 class="committee_title">Simon Grennell - Training Officer</h3>


		
					<h4 class="committee_number">Ph:&nbsp;&nbsp;085&nbsp;702&nbsp;9205</h4>		  
		  
					<p>When he&rsquo;s not busy winning long distance paddling races Simon can usually be found at club events knocking back double whiskeys like it&rsquo;s nobody&rsquo;s business. Being an active member of his hometown club Cellbridge Paddlers Canoe club Simon was an experienced kayaker before joining the club. Although he&rsquo;s studying engineering it&rsquo;s easier to locate Simon chilling in the arts block for lunch long after the majority have gone back to class. As Training Officer Simon will attempt to whip us into shape and hopefully we won&rsquo;t all be completely incompetent once varsities comes around.</p>

					<h4 class="committee_number">Ph:&nbsp;&nbsp;086&nbsp;882&nbsp;0950</h4>		  
		  
					<p>Taking over the role of &ldquo;quippy&rdquo; this year is Evan from Malahide. Evan is completing a PhD in Unmanned Arial Vehicles. When asked how his work is going Evan replies &ldquo;hopefully I&rsquo;m not creating Skynet&rdquo;. As equipment officer Evan will maintain our boats and advise our new members on what gear to bring. If Evan is capable of whipping up his own personal drone army then fixing a few cracked hulls should be no bother!</p>

					<h3 class="committee_title">Greg Healy - Public Relations Officer</h3>
		
					<h4 class="committee_number">Ph:&nbsp;&nbsp;086&nbsp;076&nbsp;5632</h4>		  
		  
					<p>Our PRO hails from metropolitan Thurles in Tipperary and has had a passion for paddling since the tender age of 20. Greg can be found studying Food Science (when it suits him to) but has in the last year taken to paddling like a pirate to rum (which he also enjoys the occasional glass of). As PRO Greg will be the buffer between Committee and the unwashed masses answering all questions and supplying justifications on demand. His mission is to ensure the craic is at least 90 at all club events through any means necessary.</p>

					<h3 class="committee_title">Sara Griffin - New Members Liason</h3>

		
					<h4 class="committee_number">Ph:&nbsp;&nbsp;087&nbsp;696&nbsp;3921</h4>		  
		  
					<p>All the way from Glenbeigh Co. Kerry which for years had hosted the yearly migration of paddlers to Merry Kerry comes our NML Sara. Not knowing the meaning of a quite night Sara can usually be found in Coppers, that is when her study of radiography isn&rsquo;t getting in the way. Unfortunately we won&rsquo;t be seeing much of Sarah on our river trips. One fateful trip to the library proved too much for Sara as she tore her ACL somewhere on the second floor proving once and for all the library should be avoided at all costs! So new members any issues are help that you might be needing this is the girl for you to go to.</p>
