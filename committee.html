      <h3>Eoghan O'Riordan - Captain</h3>
      <p>From Blessington in Wicklow, Eoghan lives in the best Dublin-adjacent kayaking county in Ireland. In the early years, Eoghan commandeered a sit-on-top kayak, hiked to the summit of a small stream at an undisclosed location in the west and made a successful first descent. The experience had a profound effect on young Eoghan and once he reached UCD he found the opportunity to pursue his childhood dream of kayaking for real, on a regular basis. He’s now in his fourth year in the club, having served terms as both NML and Safety Officer, represented UCD in intervarsity events three years running and has kayaked as far afield as France, Italy and Slovenia.</p>
			<p>Eoghan is in his final year studying Electronic and Electrical Engineering and can often be found amongst the climbers of the mountaineering club in the sports hall, talking the talk and indeed the climb.</p>

      <h3>Bill Corbett - Secretary</h3>
      <p>Bill comes from a strong kayaking/sailing/mountaineering background, based in Skerries and ranging all over (and indeed around the edges of) the country. Bill joined the club three years ago but is back after a year spent pursuing the aquisition of Mechanical Engineering knowledge throught the medium of swiss-french and google translate in Lausanne, Switzerland. After an epic voyage across Europe, despite a recently dislocated shoulder and including a Blisstick Mystic, enough gear for a year and a Micra, Bill found that his host university’s kayak club ceased activity during the colder months (ie his whole stay). Heartbroken, Bill threw himself into his studies with reckless abandon and appeared sporadically on the club’s forum, keeping up with UCDCC events and satisfying and paddling vicariously through the rest of us.</p>
			   <p>Bill is in his final year in Mechanical Engineering and has vowed to return to his former glory in kayaking one river trip at a time.</p>

      <h3>Jeremiah Dunn - Treasurer</h3>
      <p>Based in Booterstown, Jer is best described as a one in a million paddler, that is to say, the one in a million who contracts Weils disease. The illness struck at a critical time in Jer’s life; that same year he decided to change the course of his future and transfer from Electrical and Electronic Engineering (where he mostly enjoyed programming) to Computer Science (where he mostly enjoys programming). Jer beat Weils, returned to paddling and has kayaked as far afield as Slovenia, where the water is as blue and clean as mouthwash and the rats use the portaloos at the get offs. When he’s not paddling, programming or maintaining the Canoe Club’s new website, Jer likes to listen to popular music and insult everything about it.</p>
			   <p>Jer is starting his fifth year in college, his fourth in the canoe club and his second in Computer Science.</p>

      <h3>Maryanne Doyle - Safety Officer</h3>
      <p>Growing up on Dargle Road, Maryanne was destined to kayak. Her first exposure to the world of paddling came on a holiday in the west when she kayaked from Galway to Mayo and jumped off a 20 foot cliff. After establishing that UCD did not have a cliff jumping club, Maryanne joined the Canoe Club as an alternative. Now in her third year in the club, Maryanne was last year’s Equipment Officer and was often seen atop the club’s trailer at the end of river trips, developing specialised trailer climbing skills and defying gravity (she only nearly fell off twice). The canoe club way of life has proved to be somewhat of a revelation to Maryanne, who was unaware that busses ran after 11:30 until her first pool session night out. Having survived two years with the club so far with more than the average number of scars and helmet scratches, Maryanne has resolved to improve her rock dodging skills and take it easy when playing casual sports with club members.</p>
			<p>Maryanne is going into second year in Computer Science after changing from engineering, in signature canoe club style.</p>

      <h3>Matt Flood - Training Officer</h3>
      <p>Matt Flood is in his third year in the club, but has been kayaking compeditively for years, representing Wild Water Kayak Club and Ireland in competitions here and abroad. The beloved coach of all of UCDCC’s polo efforts since he arrived in on campus, Matt is often turned to for advice, both on the water and off. He thinks cags are for wimps and when cold has been known to wear a poncho. Matt coached UCD’s Dodder Rats to third place victory in Kilcock’s summer polo tournament in July as well as competeing himself, sometimes at the same time. Team members were unable to find words to describe what placing for medals meant to them.</p>
			<p>Matt is in his third year in Electronic and Electrical Engineering and wouldn’t change to computer science if every other school in the college was on fire.</p>

      <h3>Darina Muller - Equipment Officer</h3>
      <p>Originally from Germany, Darina is based in Limerick but relocates to Dublin during term time to be close at hand for kayaking activity. Also, to go to college. Darina possesses a unique advantage for her role as Equipment Officer in the coming year; she is exactly the right height to walk in the cage trailer without whacking  her head off the crossbars. A difficulty that has challenged her predecessors and added noticeably to their helmet scars and skull dents. Some say the trailer was designed to reveal the one true Equipment Officer and that Darina’s involvement with the club was foretold.</p>
			<p>Darina studies Veterinary Medicine and is going into second year.</p>

      <h3>Micheál O’Brien - Public Relations Officer</h3>
      <p>From a village near Kells, Micheál is in his third year in the club. By way of research for his current role as PRO, Micheál’s first year in the club was an exploration of its social events; he accompanied the club on weekends away (demonstrating considerable talent at last minute costume design and construction), made it all the way to Kerry (the year the insides of the windows froze in the cold) and sampled the UCDCC night life on a number of occasions. The following year Micheál went all-out and began to experience the paddling side of the club more and more, developing his paddling and polo skills and even representing UCD in a long distance race over the summer.</p>
			<p>Micheál is studying science and enjoys pulling club trailers in his spare time.</p>

      <h3>Dani Maguire - New Members Liason</h3>
      <p>Based in Dublin, Dani’s house is tactically located in Carrickmines, within running distance of any kayaking expedition leaving for Wicklow by the N11 or M50. Dani is in her second year in the club, as is customary for the NML, and remembers well what it's like to be a fresher. She knows when to give a comforting pat on the back, a reassuring smile, and when to tell freshers to just man up and paddle over that horizon line. Dani sampled a wide range of club events last year and even overcame the challenges of kayaking a leaking boat down rapids in Kerry at New Year's. Last year's equipment officer is still living that one down...</p>
			<p>Dani's in second year, is studying science and once fought a bear and won.</p>
