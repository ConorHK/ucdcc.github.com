				<h3>Fresher tip - starting out</h3>
				<p>Joined at the start of the year but haven't been to an event yet? Don't let that stop you for a second! There is a constant stream of new members throughout the staring weeks of each semester, you won't be out of place or behind the rest and we're always happy to see new members, when it comes down to it, it's not when you start but how long you stay for.</p>

			<h2>Pool session</h2>
			<p>UCD does not yet have a pool on campus, so the canoe club uses a pool in town for its weekly training sessions. We meet at the main gates of Trinity at 18:30 and walk over to Seán McDermott Street pool together soon after. Starting off new members must complete a basic swim test (mostly to check you won't sink) and a capsize drill (safe exit from a capsized kayak, instructed one-on-one on the night). With the formalities out of the way, pool sessions are the perfect place to learn basic skills (low brace, t-rescue, roll) in a low risk, warm, indoor environment. Each pool session costs €2 and lasts for one hour, once it's up the club heads out to the pub for a night out.</p>
			<p>The €2 pool charge goes towards paying for the use of the pool and supervision by a fully qualified lifeguard, the remaining cost is subsidised by the club.</p>
				
				<h3>Fresher tip - pool party</h3>
				<p>Bring togs, towel and toiletries for the shower. We head on to the pub for a night out after and the dress code is very relaxed! We're all coming from the pool, so no need to worry about having wet hair or being a bit scruffy!</p>

			<h2>Saturday Trips</h2>
			<p>Get paddling on a real live river! Meet at the club's boathouse on campus MAP at 10:00, bring €10, get your gear on the trailer and head off for the Liffey, Boyne or more exotic locations further afield when the rains come! Get a chance to try out skills you've learned in the pool and learn new skills and techniques for moving water. Each group of beginners will be coached by a qualified instructor and accompanied by a group of experienced club members, both to offer support and have a bit of fun getting to know each other.</p>
			<p>The €10 club trip fee includes the cost of the bus for the day, remaining costs are subsidised by the club.</p>
				
				<h3>Fresher tip - boathouse</h3>
				<p>Before leaving campus for a river trip you should make sure that there's a boat with airbags, paddles, buoyancy aid, helmet and spray deck on board the trailer for you. This takes time, so arrive early for best results, and after we get back you should make sure they all get hung up again! The committee and older members will be on hand to help you pick out gear for river trips at the beginning of the year, but the earlier you arrive the better!</p>
				
				<h3>Fresher tip - keeping warm</h3>
				<p>Ireland is not known for its fabulous weather and while rain is a welcome thing for paddlers, cold is not. If you have a wetsuit, bring it with you, and/or find yourself old pairs of tights, fleeces and non-cotton or wool based clothes in general. Inexpensive to buy and readily available, keep an eye on the board for alerts on special deals in various shops.</p>

You can like our facebook page or follow us on twitter to include us in your social networking habits and read our blog for personal accounts of what the club gets up to.</p>
