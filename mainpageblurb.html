		<h1>UCD Canoe Club</h1>
			<p>
					BOAST: UCD Canoe Club is one of the largest and oldest canoe clubs in Ireland and remains one of UCD's most vibrant and active clubs. Celebrating its 35th anniversary this year, the Canoe Club is also one of the largest and oldest kayaking clubs in the country.
			</p>
			<p>
			  SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE: The club offers a range of competitive and non-competitive kayaking and caters for a variety of kayaking and canoeing disciplines; river running, whitewater, freestyle, polo and even the odd bit of marathon.
			</p>
			<p>
			  ACTIVITY: Each week the club offers a pool skills training session and a Saturday river trip where members learn the basics and   develop their kayaking ability.
			</p>
			<p>
			  SOCIAL: Meet for lunch on Mondays or Tuesdays, come to the pub for a night out after each training session and attend talks and presentations about kayaking adventures made by current members and alumni.
			</p>
			<p>
			  TRIPS: Three weekend trips and a weeklong expedition; new members are introduced to the club with style at Freshers' Weekend in October, try kayak surfing with Trinity's canoe club at Lahinch in November, witness paddlers from around the country coming together in Kerry for New Years' and compete against thirteen college canoe and kayak clubs at Varsities in February.
