		<h3>Maryanne Doyle - Captain</h3>
		<p>Growing up on Dargle Road, Maryanne was destined to kayak. Her first exposure to the world of paddling came on a holiday in the west when she kayaked from Galway to Mayo and jumped off a 20 foot cliff. After establishing that UCD did not have a cliff jumping club, Maryanne joined the Canoe Club as an alternative. Now in her fourth year in the club, Maryanne was last years Safety Officer and could often be found colour coding lists of freshers for various skills training and assessment activities. With a younger sister who completed her leaving cert at the end of last year, Maryanne has been thinking about the incoming freshers a lot this summer, remembering her first introduction to the canoe club as being one of the best experiences of her time at college. Three years on Maryanne has spent part of every summer kayaking in the Alps (Italy, France and Slovenia) all in the pursuit of finding someplace warm enough to kayak without a drysuit.</p>
		<p>Maryanne is going into third year in Computer Science after changing from engineering, in signature canoe club style.</p>

		<h3>Derv McAuley - Secretary</h3>
		<p>Derv grew up Limerick with her family who are all paddling enthusiasts. She is following in the footsteps of her sister Nuala McAuley, who is also a devoted UCDCC member. She remembers her first paddling experience with her family, when she was 13, on the lower Carragh. She managed to fall out of her boat and spent most of the day not actually paddling, but following the boat down to the sea to retrieve it. This first experience did not phase young Derv and she continued her kayaking adventures throughout her teenage years. Her experience prior to joining the club along with her kayaking skillage was an inspiration to the rest of the freshers who joined along with her, as she constantly pushed the boundaries of the first years.</p>
		<p>She is currently in 2nd year mechanical engineering and is loving it.</p>

		  <h3>Ellen McGrane - Treasurer</h3>
		  <p>Ellen comes from the far, far away town of Booterstown, from whence she actually commutes by foot everyday into college. She joined the club only last year, having hopped onto the bus to the Freshers Weekend, knowing very few kayakers and with no paddling experience. Her daily fitness training into college stood by her as she progressed in leaps and bounds in the paddling world. Over the past year she has grown to know many kayakers and paddle quite proficiently. Go Ellen.</p>
		  <p>Ellen is in 3rd year chemical engineering. A course requiring a good head for numbers, its no surprise that she was appointed this years treasurer.</p>

		  <h3>Bill Corbett - Safety Officer</h3>
		  <p>Bill comes from a strong kayaking/sailing/mountaineering background, based in Skerries and ranging all over (and indeed around the edges of) the country. Bill joined the club four years ago and spent one of those years on Erasmus in Switzerland to pursue the acquisition of Mechanical Engineering knowledge through the medium of swiss-french and google translate. Unfortunately his host universitys canoe club ceased all kayaking activity for most of the time Bill was there, a slight he made up for last summer by travelling to Slovenia and spending an intense two and a half weeks honing his own skills and working as a safety boater to guard others. Perfect training for his position as Safety Officer this coming year!</p>
		  <p>Bill is in his first year of a Masters in Mechanical Engineering, achieving the philosophical state of Master Fresheror Fresher Master, depending how you look at it.</p>

		  <h3>Niall Bouchier - Training Officer</h3>
		  <p>Niall Bouchier has been an active member of the club since his first encounter with UCD a few years ago. This September will see Niall come back to UCD after working in a gourmet restaurant in town for the last while.  This young man will prove as fierce competition for anyone in the running for fresher of the year cup for 2012/2013, so newbies watch out! Niall has a wealth of experience in all aspects of canoeing and kayaking competitions and has already put together a great schedule of events over the summer including assembling several polo teams for tournaments, intervarsity long distance training and level three kayaking skills training.</p>
		  <p>Niall is going into his first year studying computer science.</p>

		  <h3>Diarmuid Ryan - Equipment Officer</h3>
		  <p>Diarmuid is also in his 2nd year of the club as well at his 2nd year studying Engineering in UCD. He plans to continue studying Electronic and Computer Engineering next year, having been heavily influenced by many a club member towards the Computer Science side of the world. Diarmuid has always prided himself in his logic and manliness, like the time he manly-ly threw a black sack of rubbish into a skip (logical) only the bag wasnt full of rubbish, it had all of his kayaking gear in it. Luckily the gear was swiftly recovered and from that moment Diarmuid vowed to protect kayaking equipment  from all harm to the best of his ability, making him perfectly qualified for this years appointment as Equipment Officer. The lovely looking boathouse is but a sample of the great things Diarmuid has in store for us in the forthcoming year!</p>
		  <p>He remembers his first experience in a boat as quite a terrifying one. But being the man he is, he overcame this obstacle and now loves the sport.</p>

		  <h3>Róisín Mossop - Public Relations Officer</h3>
		  <p>Róisín started her canoeing career at the tender age of 12, when she spent four long years roaming Dun Loaghaire harbour in a kayak and avoiding its nuclear seals. Once she joined UCD she realised that kayaking actually has a lot more to it that avoiding seals and forward paddling. She grew to enjoy the thrill of shooting down the odd weir or playing on a small feature on rivers. Every now and then if you find her on a long stretch of flat water you can hear her making seal-like sounds, beckoning to her lost friends in an effort to bring them back to her.</p>
		  <p>She is currently in 3rd year electronic and electrical engineering, and it is her 2nd year paddling with the club.</p>

		  <h3>Niall Finch - New Members Liason</h3>
		  <p>Niall Finch is from the lovely town of Enniskerry in Co. Wicklow. Undoubtedly, living so near to the rapid rivers of Wicklow inspired him to join the club and hes never once looked back. Although he did not have much paddling experience prior to joining the club, Niall jumped at every opportunity to take part in, and enjoy all aspects of UCDCC, from river trips to weekends away, polo to partay! On an interesting side note, Niall pronounces his name kneel unlike Niall who pronounces his name nile. Unlike most of the committee (and indeed most of the club members) Niall has never been a student of engineering, which helps him relate to minorities in the club. Always ready to make a joke or pull a face (see diagram adjacent to bio) Niall well suited to lightening the mood at the top of a weir or in the carpark after the first sighting of any brown water.</p>
		  <p>This friendly face for all freshers is currently in his 2nd year science and 2nd year of the club and ready for more!</p>
