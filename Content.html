		<h1>UCD Canoe Club</h1>
			BOAST: UCD Canoe Club is one of the largest and oldest canoe clubs in Ireland and remains one of UCD's most vibrant and active clubs. Celebrating its 35th anniversary this year, the Canoe Club is also one of the largest and oldest kayaking clubs in the country.
			SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE: The club offers a range of competitive and non-competitive kayaking and caters for a variety of kayaking and canoeing disciplines; river running, whitewater, freestyle, polo and even the odd bit of marathon and long distance.
			ACTIVITY: Each week the club offers a pool skills training session where members can learn the basics in a controlled environment and a Saturday river trip where further techniques can be developed learn the basics and develop their kayaking ability.
			SOCIAL: Meet for lunch on Mondays or Tuesdays, come to the pub for a night out after each training session and attend talks and presentations about kayaking adventures made by current members and alumni.
			TRIPS: Three weekend trips and a weeklong expedition; new members are introduced to the club with style at Freshers' Weekend in October, try kayak surfing with Trinity's canoe club at Lahinch in November, witness paddlers from around the country coming together in Kerry for New Years' and compete against thirteen college canoe and kayak clubs at Varsities in February.
		
		<h1>Disciplines</h1>
		
			<h2>River Running</h2>
			The most practised discipline the club offers; suitable for new members, paddlers and oldies alike. Embark on a river trip from A to B on grade 2/2+/3 water, enjoy the cameraderie of a group, negotiate weirs, learn about eddy lines, get a handle on flowing water techniques and take advantage of relatively low volume waters to try new things in a low consequence environment.
			Club river running trips are held every Saturday on rivers around Dublin, starting on the Liffey and Boyne. They present an ideal environment for new members to learn the basics and for older hands to consolidate and hone skills and to experiment with new techniques. New members can expect to receive demonstrations of, and coaching on, techniques on the Level 2 and 3 kayaking syllabi and are encouraged undergo a level 3 Skills assessment once they’ve gained enough experience and technical ability.

			<h2>White Water</h2>
			The most photographed discipline offered by the club; entry level whitewater (grade 3/3+) is suitable for new members who’ve invested some time on the basics, and the higher end (grade 4/4+/5/5+) can give even the most experienced paddlers a run for their money! Encounter rapids and drops  initialy and progress to run waterfalls, punch through holes and negotiate pourovers.
			Club trips featuring white water take place in Wicklow later in the year, new members can experience higher volume paddling for the first time and are encouraged join in with the more experienced paddlers in running rapids and wavetrains as many times as possible, all in the name of catching the white water bug.
			UCD Canoe Club enters teams in white water races around the country during the year, including the Colligan Gorge Games and Wacko on the Jacko. These competitions are a great opportunity for paddlers  to gain experience on more challenging irish white water and represent their college.
			Private trips are often organised and see UCD paddlers running white water rivers around Ireland on their days off, such as the Dargle, Glenmacnas, Upper Liffey, Glens, Roughty and the Flesk. In the summer many choose to visit the Alps to experience the next level of white water, touring France, Italy, Slovenia and Switzerland and sampling what Europe has to offer.

			<h2>Polo</h2>
			The only kayak based ball sport recognised by the World Games, canoe polo is the perfect stage on which to combine paddling skills with strategy, team skills and athleticism. New members are encouraged to give it a go and even form a beginner team to enter in the Dublin Canoe Polo League.
			Polo teams comprise of four (indoors) or five (outdoors) players, including one goalie, playing at a time.  Players wear full face helmets, slimmed down bouyancy aids and specialised polo decks and must shoot the ball in the opposing team’s goal, a rectangle suspended a paddle-height above the water. The game, played in 7 minute halves, is fast and furious or speedy and skillful depending on who you ask.
			A minority sport in Ireland (and indeed the world) canoe polo is played by several clubs and colleges around the country and polo competitions are held at intervals during the year, including a polo tournament at the kayaking intervarsities.

			<h2>Freestyle</h2>
			Featuring the smallest, most responsive boats in the club’s armada, freestyle is a discipline accessible to new members who’ve spent some time on the basics and are looking to try surfing or to attempt some basic tricks; waves, air-guitars, spins and maybe even a pop out.
			Freestyle paddlers make use of features on a river, such as a wave or a hole, and use core skills to manipulate their boat and acheive a variety of impressive results; blunts, loops, cartwheels and even crazier moves like a Phonix Monkey or a McNasty.

		<h1>The Committee</h1>
		Each year a committee of eight is elected to organise the following year’s events and promote the club. Each member’s role is outlined by their position, but most events are brought about by teamwork. The committee work hard throughout the year encouraging new members to join, promoting the club and doing their best to ensure that all club members have numerous opportunities to enjoy all the club has to offer.
		The 2011/12 team comprise of:

			<h2>Eoghan O’Riordan - Captain</h2>
			From Blessington in Wicklow, Eoghan lives in the best Dublin-adjacent kayaking county in Ireland. In the early years, Eoghan commandeered a sit-on-top kayak, hiked to the summit of a small stream at an undisclosed location in the west and made a successful first descent. The experience had a profound effect on young Eoghan and once he reached UCD he found the opportunity to pursue his childhood dream of kayaking for real, on a regular basis. He’s now in his fourth year in the club, having served terms as both NML and Safety Officer, represented UCD in intervarsity events three years running and has kayaked as far afield as France, Italy and Slovenia.
			Eoghan is in his final year studying Electronic and Electrical Engineering and can often be found amongst the climbers of the mountaineering club in the sports hall.

			<h2>Bill Corbett - Secretary</h2>
			Bill comes from a strong kayaking/sailing/mountaineering background, based in Skerries and ranging all over (and indeed around the edges of) the country. Bill joined the club three years ago but is back after a year spent pursuing the aquisition of Mechanical Engineering knowledge throught the medium of swiss-french and google translate in Lausanne, Switzerland. After an epic voyage across Europe, despite a recently dislocated shoulder and including a Blisstick Mystic, enough gear for a year and a Micra, Bill found that his host university’s kayak club ceased activity during the colder months (ie his whole stay). Heartbroken, Bill threw himself into his studies with reckless abandon and appeared sporadically on the club’s forum, keeping up with UCDCC events.
			Bill is in his final year in Mechanical Engineering and has vowed to return to his former glory in kayaking one river trip at a time.

			<h2>Jer Dunn - Treasurer</h2>
			Based in Booterstown, Jer is best described as a one in a million paddler, that is to say, the one in a million who contracts Weils disease. The illness struck at a critical time in Jer’s life; that same year he decided to change the course of his future and transfer from Electrical and Electronic Engineering (where he mostly enjoyed programming) to Computer Science (where he mostly enjoys programming). Jer beat Weils, returned to paddling and has kayaked as far as Slovenia, where the water is as blue and clean as mouthwash and the rats use the portaloos at the get offs. When he’s not paddling, programming or maintaining the Canoe Club’s new website, Jer likes to listen to popular music and insult everything about it.
			Jer is starting his fifth year in college, his fourth in the canoe club and his second in Computer Science.

			<h2>Maryanne Doyle - Safety Officer</h2>
			Growing up on Dargle Road, Maryanne was destined to kayak. Her first exposure to the world of paddling came on a holiday in the west when she kayaked from Galway to Mayo and jumped off a 20 foot cliff. After establishing that UCD did not have a cliff jumping club, Maryanne joined the Canoe Club as an alternative. Now in her third year in the club, Maryanne was last year’s Equipment Officer and was often seen atop the club’s trailer at the end of river trips, developing specialised trailer climbing skills, and only nearly fell off twice. The canoe club way of life has proved to be somewhat of a revelation to Maryanne, who was unaware that busses ran after 11:30 until her first pool session night out. Having survived two years with the club so far with more than the average number of scars and helmet scratches, Maryanne has resolved to improve her rock dodging skills and take it easy when playing casual sports with club members.
			Maryanne is going into second year in Computer Science after changing from engineering, in signature canoe club style.

			<h2>Matt Flood - Training Officer</h2>
			Matt Flood is in his third year in the club, but has been kayaking compeditively for years, representing Wild Water Kayak Club and Ireland in competitions here and abroad. The beloved coach of all of UCDCC’s polo efforts since he arrived in on campus, Matt is often turned to for advice, both on the water and off. He thinks cags are for wimps and when cold has been known to wear a poncho. Matt coached UCD’s Dodder Rats to third place victory in Kilcock’s summer polo tournament in July as well as competeing himself, sometimes at the same time. Team members were unable to find words to describe what placing for medals meant to them.
			Matt is in his third year in Electronic and Electrical Engineering and wouldn’t change to computer science if every other school in the college was on fire.

			<h2>Darina Muller – Equipment Officer</h2>
			Originally from Germany, Darina is based in Limerick but relocates to Dublin during term time to be close at hand for kayaking activity. Also, to go to college. Darina possesses a unique advantage for her role as Equipment Officer in the coming year; she is exactly the right height to walk in the cage trailer without whacking  her head off the crossbars. A difficulty that has challenged her predecessors and added noticeably to their helmet scars and skull dents. Some say the trailer was designed to reveal the one true Equipment Officer and that Darina’s involvement with the club was foretold.
			Darina studies Veterinary Medicine and is going into second year.

			<h2>Micheál O’Brien – Public Relations Officer</h2>
			From a village near Kells, Micheál is in his third year in the club. By way of research for his current role as PRO, Micheál’s first year in the club was an exploration of its social events; he accompanied the club on weekends away (demonstrating considerable talent at last minute costume design and construction), made it all the way to Kerry (the year the insides of the windows froze in the cold) and sampled the UCDCC night life on a number of occasions. The following year Micheál went all-out and began to experience the paddling side of the club more and more, developing his paddling and polo skills and even representing UCD in a long distance race over the summer.
			Micheál is studying science and enjoys pulling trailers in his spare time.

			<h2>Dani Maguire – New Members Liason</h2>
			Based in Dublin, Dani’s house is tactically located in Carrickmines, within running distance of any kayaking expedition leaving for Wicklow by the N11 or M50. Dani is in her second year in the club, as is customary for the NML, and remembers well what it's like to be a fresher. She knows when to give a comforting pat on the back, a reassuring smile, and when to tell freshers to just man up and paddle over that horizon line. Dani sampled a wide range of club events last year and even overcame the challenges of kayaking a leaking boat down rapids in Kerry at New Year's. Last year's equipment officer is still living that one down...
			Dani's in second year, is studying science and once fought a bear and won.

			<h2>Boathouse</h2>
			The Canoe Club’s on-campus headquarters, the boathouse has played an important role in UCDCC proceedings for years. Home to an extensive and eclectic selection of club-owned boats, safety equipment, trailers, lost and found and an impressive collection of miscellaneous items belonging to the club (eg a paddling pool, a zebra patterned cowboy hat and a toy sword)
			Each Saturday trip starts and ends at the boathouse, providing new members with all the gear they require for a river trip; buoyancy aid, helmet, semi-dry cag, spray deck, paddles and a boat.
	
			<h2>Seán McDermott Street Swimming Pool</h2>
			The club's weekly pool training sessions are held here, until the new UCD pool is opened that is... (The latest rumours hint that that might occur early in semester one of the 2012/2013 academic year)
			Club members meet at the main gates of Trinity College at 18:30 and make the fifteen minute walk to the pool together. Early in the year an older member or two will wait at Trinity to accompany any lost freshers.

		<h1> Events </h1>

			<h2> Freshers’ Weekend </h2>
			In mid-October the club loads a fifty-seater bus and makes an unforgettable journey to any one of a variety of locations around the country. The trip is aimed at giving new members a taste of what the Canoe Club really is and incorporates over 50 hours of kayaking and social madness. The weekend starts as soon as lectures finish on a Friday, with many members meeting on campus in the afternoon. The bus leaves once those unlucky enough to have labs on a Friday are done and the party gets into full swing as we journey out of Dublin, move into a hostel and sample the local nightlife. Included in the price of the weekend are: use of the bus for the weekend, two kayaking trips (on Saturday and Sunday morning), two breakfasts, one dinner, instruction by qualified instructors and accommodation for both nights.
			Freshers' Weekend: paddle and party all weekend long, see Saturday night fancy dress Canoe Club style for the first time, meet the oldies, survive the hooch and 

			<h2> Lahinch </h2>
			In mid-November the club embarks on an annual campaign to Lahinch, County Clare, for Colours weekend where we battle Trinity College Dublin to come home with the Colours Cup and all the glory and bragging rights it entails. The kayaking portion of the weekend is unique throughout the year as the club tries its hand at kayak-surfing and the Saturday night fancy dress has a theme chosen weeks in advance to provide ample time to come up with something amazing, shocking or at least funny. This weekend, everything is a competition: who gets there first, who has the most fun partying, who surfs the biggest wave, whose freshers paddle the most, whose freshers swim the most, whose committee breaks down first, who has the greater number of attending oldies, who brings the most guitars, who sings for the longest, whose bus is the biggest, whose trailer is the shiniest, whose helmets are the roundest and who wins the fabled Ennistymon Falls Boatercross.
			Lahinch: meet DUKC, Trinity's kayak club, represent your college in a series of competitions (mostly friendly) and try kayak surfing in one of Ireland's top surf destinations.

			<h2> Kerry </h2>
			Kayakers from around the country gather in Kerry at New Year's every year, and UCD Canoe Club are in the thick of it; occupying two club houses, as many as five private houses, trailer in tow and staying all week long. Paddling in Kerry is often a fresher's first taste of real rapids and have been known to request running the same stretch of river as many times as possible during the week. If the weather is dry the club takes advantage of our fantastic location and runs kayak surfing expeditions both nearby and in the breathtakingly beautiful Finian's Bay an hour's drive away. Each night has a party, ranging from a "quiet" club house party to New Years' Eve which sees dozens and dozens of paddlers from around the country gathered in The Rossbeigh Inn for an amazing night. UCD holds a pub quiz each year, whose winners receive their choice of paddling or partying gear and of course a healthy amount of bragging rights. The club does not provide a bus to Kerry, giving the perfect opportunity to meet more members of the as they make their way down by car, train, bus and negotiate lifts with any club drivers who'll have them.
			Kerry: live in a Canoe Club village for a week, paddle as much as possible, socialise every night, compete for prizes in the quiz, meet paddlers from other colleges, see the super-oldies, make a note on every calendar from now on that come New Year's, this is the place to be.

			<h2> Varsities </h2>
			Once a year canoe and kayaking clubs from around the country send delegates to participate in the prestigious Kayaking Intervarsity Competition. UCD has a fine tradition of fine representation in all four events; canoe polo, white water, long distance and freestyle
