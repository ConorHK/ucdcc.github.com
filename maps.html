			<h2>Boathouse</h2>
			<p>The Canoe Club’s on-campus headquarters, the boathouse has played an important role in UCDCC proceedings for years. Home to an extensive and eclectic selection of club-owned boats, safety equipment, trailers, lost and found and an impressive collection of miscellaneous items belonging to the club (eg a paddling pool, a zebra patterned cowboy hat and a toy sword).</p>
			<p>Each Saturday trip starts and ends at the boathouse, providing new members with all the gear they require for a river trip; buoyancy aid, helmet, semi-dry cag, spray deck, paddles and a boat. Members should remember to bring their own swimming togs, old runners and warm layers (non-cotton eg: clothing fleeces, tights).</p>
	
			<h2>Seán McDermott Street Swimming Pool</h2>
			<p>The club's weekly pool training sessions are held here, until the new UCD pool is opened that is... (The latest rumours hint that that might occur early in semester one of the 2012/2013 academic year)</p>
			<p>Club members meet at the main gates of Trinity College at 18:30 and make the fifteen minute walk to the pool together. Early in the year an older member or two will wait at Trinity to accompany any lost freshers.</p>
